                 <h3> AI</h3>
                 <p>The history of AI began with theoretical explorations in the mid-20th century, evolving from early concepts of machines that could think, to the formalization of the field at the Dartmouth Workshop in 1956. Key figures like Alan Turing, John McCarthy, and Marvin Minsky laid the groundwork, with Turing's Turing Test and McCarthy coining the term "artificial intelligence". Early AI focused on rule-based systems, expert systems, and machine learning, facing periods of both excitement and setbacks. The 1990s saw a resurgence with neural networks and the explosion of data, leading to modern AI's capabilities. 
                    Key Milestones and Figures:
                    Early Theoretical Work (1930s-1950s):
                    Alan Turing's work on computing machines and the Turing Test in 1950 laid the foundation for thinking about machine intelligence. 
                    Birth of AI as a Field (1956):
                    The Dartmouth workshop, organized by John McCarthy, formally defined AI as a field of study and coined the term. 
                    Early AI Systems (1950s-1960s):
                    Logic Theorist (1955) and the General Problem Solver (1957) were early programs that mimicked human problem-solving. 
                    Expert Systems (1970s-1980s):
                    Systems like MYCIN (1972) and Dendral (1971) demonstrated AI's potential in specific domains. 
                    AI Winter (1970s-1980s):
                    Disillusionment and reduced funding due to limited progress in AI's goals. 
                    Neural Networks and Machine Learning (1980s-1990s):
                    The resurgence of neural networks and the development of machine learning techniques. 
                    IBM Deep Blue (1997):
                    Deep Blue defeated the world chess champion, showcasing AI's capabilities in complex tasks. 
                    Data Explosion and Modern AI (Late 1990s-Present):
                    The rise of big data and improved computational power propelled modern AI's advancements.
